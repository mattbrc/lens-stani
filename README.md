# Lens-Stani Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It was created in response to [@StaniKulechov's](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov) tweet, found [here.](https://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1534587764708196353)

The project is a simple dapp with a connect to wallet function. The only person who can access the contents of the app after logging in is Stani, as the dapp is encrypted to the owner of Stani's Lens Profile NFT. The dapp additionally uses the Lens Social Graph to query some data from my personal profile, [@mattbrc.lens](https://www.lensfrens.xyz/mattbrc.lens). 

You can view the live deploy at: [Deployed Site](https://lens-stani-krc8ez0b3-acid-gambit.vercel.app/).
